Code samples for a yui3-presentation

<h1>SimpleTodo</h1>

<p>There are two folders for SimpleTodo - SimpleTodo (skeleton) and SimpleTodo_complete (completed, obviously).  This shows several features of YUI3 in a Todo example.  Data does not persist over refreshes</p>

<h1>ModelTodo</h1>

<p>This is a more complex version of the Todo application.  It uses elements from the App framework to better handle the Todo lifecycle, including persisting to browser storage.  It exposes several more features of YUI3, including hooking into the Gallery.</p>
